TODOs:
[HIGH] [WIP] Add submit function in build jobs.
Set github copilot prompts for Teamcity DSL to have a better usage.



BUGS:
The windows build issue looks like the script in template cannot call the bat file correctly. Need to check if the bat file is exists.
debug regular night build issue, need to check if it triggers properly.
The entire build chain will stuck not fail if one of the build cannot get correct agent. For example, used an incorrect parameter.
ENTRANCE change log seems displayed changes in other branches
